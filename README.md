# Color Unchained

Color Unchained is a simple mod which allows you to use Minecraft color formatting in different text areas around the game. This includes the chatbox, anvil names, written books, and signs. 

In the 4 relevant GUIs, you'll see a small RGB button in the top left of your screen:

Click it to reveal color options along with different formatting types!

Once you've clicked on the color you want, start typing. You can also use multiple colors and styles in a single message:

Signs can be colored in a similar fashion:

Want a cool weapon? How about a non-italicized colored name?

Books are a beta feature and you may find bugs with it.

If you don't want to use the color button in the chat screen, you can use %% as a replacement for the color format key.
